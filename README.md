# Predicting-Building-Energy-Efficiency-Supervised-Learning-
i am working for an architecture firm, and task is to build a model that predicts the energy efficiency rating of buildings based on features like wall area, roof area, overall height, etc.
Supervised Learning Code: To predict the energy efficiency of buildings.

In this exercise, you trained a RandomForestRegressor model to predict the energy efficiency of buildings based on features such as wall area, roof area, overall height, and glazing area.



Expected Results
Data Visualizations - Scatter plots will show the relationship between each feature and the target variable (energy efficiency). Students should observe how changes in features may relate to energy efficiency, although with synthetic data, these relationships might not show clear trends.
Model Performance - After training the model and making predictions, students will evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE). With synthetic data, the MSE value may vary, but it gives an idea of the average error in the model's predictions. The closer this value is to zero, the better the model's performance.
Prediction vs. True Value Plot - The scatter plot comparing true values and model predictions should ideally show points along the diagonal line (y=x), indicating accurate predictions. Deviations from this line suggest prediction errors.
